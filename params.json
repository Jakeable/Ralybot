{"name":"Ralybot","tagline":"Welcome to the official repository for Ralybot. Ralybot is a fork of CloudBot Refresh, another awesome IRC bot written in the Python programming language.","body":"# Ralybot\r\n\r\nRalybot is a simple, fast, expandable open-source Python IRC bot, and is a fork of another awesome bot called CloudBot.\r\n\r\n## Getting Ralybot\r\n\r\nThere are currently two different branches of this repository, each with a different level of stability:\r\n - **python3.4** *(main, but unstable!)*: This branch is the main branch in the repository, but might contain unstable, untested code. You have been warned!\r\n\r\n## Installing Ralybot\r\n\r\nFirstly, Ralybot will only run on **Python 3.4.3 or higher**. Because we use the asyncio module, you will not be able to use any other versions of Python.\r\n\r\nTo install Ralybot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-*nix)\r\n\r\nTo install Ralybot on Windows, see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-Windows)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Running Ralybot\r\n\r\nBefore you run the bot, rename `config.default.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!\r\n\r\nOnce you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\npython3.4 -m Ralybot\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.\r\n```\r\npython3.4 Ralybot/cloudbot/__main__.py\r\n```\r\nSpecify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.\r\n\r\n## Getting help with Ralybot\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\nThe Ralybot documentation is currently somewhat outdated and may not be correct.
