# Ralybot

Ralybot is a simple, fast, expandable open-source Python IRC bot, and is a fork of another awesome bot called CloudBot.

## Getting Ralybot

There are currently two different branches of this repository, each with a different level of stability:
 - **python3.4** *(main, but unstable!)*: This branch is the main branch in the repository, but might contain unstable, untested code. You have been warned!

## Installing Ralybot

Firstly, Ralybot will only run on **Python 3.4 or higher**. Because we use the asyncio module, you will not be able to use any other versions of Python.

To install Ralybot on *nix (linux, etc), see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-*nix)

To install Ralybot on Windows, see [here](https://github.com/CloudBotIRC/CloudBot/wiki/Installing-on-Windows)


### Running Ralybot

Before you run the bot, rename `config.default.json` to `config.json` and edit it with your preferred settings. You can check if your JSON is valid using [jsonlint.com](http://jsonlint.com/)!

Once you have installed the required dependencies and renamed the config file, you can run the bot! Make sure you are in the correct folder and run the following command:

```
python3.4 -m Ralybot
```

Note that you can also run the `cloudbot/__main__.py` file directly, which will work from any directory.
```
python3.4 Ralybot/cloudbot/__main__.py
```
Specify the path as /path/to/repository/cloudbot/__main__.py, where `cloudbot` is inside the repository directory.
